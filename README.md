## Objectives
To assess application health for improving Stability, Maintainability and Availability, through guided walkthrough of functional, technical and deployment requirements. 


***

## Scope and Focus area
Assess application health from viewpoints of various industry standard biomarkers like 
 * Modularity, security, maintainability, reusability, availability, reliability, extensibility and performance.
 * Assessment on usage of design principle, design patterns, Test Driven Development (TDD), secure coding practices etc.
 * Findings on amount of code complexity, code duplications and code fragmentation.


## Out of scope
 1. Current integration architecture and designs.
 2. Analysis or documentation of detailed business process or functional requirements.
 3. Analysis of third party managed solutions.
 4. In-depth application documentation and code review of all modules. 
 5. Assessments and recommendations around people mgmt, project execution and cloud migration.
 6. Bug/defect/ITSM ticket related assessments and recommending fixes.

## Analysis approach


 ### Engage & Discovery
 1. Kick off session with discussion around pain points/areas.
 2. Understand functional flow of application from functional SME.
 3. Overview of AS-IS application architecture, components and infrastructure from Technical SME.
 4. High level walkthrough of inventory (Functional requirements, Architecture documents, Design documents, deployment designs etc.).
 5. Understand various upstream and downstream integration points. 
 6. Share application health review checklist.



 ### Analysis 
 1. Code walkthrough sessions with Tech SME to peer review the codebase for few usecases, ideally few complex, few medium and few simple use cases. 
 2. Get/Use tool based automated code review like SonarQube, SourceMeter, CodeSense, CAST etc.
 3. Perform self code review of latest release/current codebase (Sampling based).
 4. Review of deployment architecture and scalability designs.
 5. Validate the findings of peer and self code review from application health review checklist.
 6. Document observations that needs to be validated and reported.



 ### Recommendations and Next steps
 1. Executive summary supplemented with metrics from Application health assessment findings.

 2. Detailed report on the vulnerabilities found with possible fixes.
 3. Recommend immediate areas for addressing stability, maintainability, performance etc.
 4. Gap analysis report - Recommendations on approach for tech stack and infrastructure upgrades to meet technical and deployment requirements.
